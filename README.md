# GameProject

The brief was to create a javascript game of your choosing. 
The game i picked was Noughts and Crosses in this game you will see the knowledge I have gained over the weeks to make it interactive and functional.

The aim would be to add a single player option where there is calculated AI turns so yuo can play with yourself.
